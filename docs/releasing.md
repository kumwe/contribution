# Release protocol

CHANGELOG's newest second-level semantic-version heading is authoritative; Unreleased is skipped and malformed headings fail closed. 0.1.0 is a proposed initial record, not proof of publication.

CI and release-on-record both run composer check on PHP 8.5. Publication runs only on main push after the full gate, serializes without cancellation, and grants write permission only to its release job. Actions use reviewed SHA pins. The API creates a missing tag at the exact tested main SHA only after a confirmed 404. Existing tags must belong to main history and match their release record; an unpublished tag must match the exact tested commit. Existing releases remain immutable. Agents never push tags or merge.

The built ZIP installs as a dependency in a fresh no-dev/no-scripts/no-plugins/classmap-authoritative Composer project. Its package repository points to that ZIP, never a path checkout. Packagist is disabled for the PHP-only isolated consumer. Manifested symbols and shipped example run via that consumer's autoloader. Archive verification enforces the reviewed allowlist and absence of tests/tools/vendor/development state.

After initial Packagist submission, its GitHub integration follows tags without workflow credentials. Independent verification records tag/source, archive digest, manifests, registry coordinate, license/security evidence and clean consumer in external RELEASE-ATTESTATION.yaml. Never embed the artifact's final digest or invented release claims in its own handoff.

Exact pre-1.0 pins are required. Release defects need new versions/advisories, not tag movement. SDK then App adoption are separate verified-release tasks.
